    "# Lab 1 (b)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "In this lab, we'll explore how to host a large language model on Amazon SageMaker using  [Hugging Face LLM Inference Container for Amazon SageMaker](https://huggingface.co/blog/sagemaker-huggingface-llm), which allows you to easily deploy the most popular open-source LLMs, including Falcon, StarCoder, BLOOM, GPT-NeoX, Llama, and T5\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models have recently exploded in both size and popularity. In 2018, BERT-large entered the scene and, with its 340M parameters and novel transformer architecture, set the standard on NLP task accuracy. Within just a few years, state-of-the-art NLP model size has grown by more than 500x with models such as OpenAI’s 175 billion parameter GPT-3 and similarly sized open source Bloom 176B raising the bar on NLP accuracy. This increase in the number of parameters is driven by the simple and empirically-demonstrated positive relationship between model size and accuracy: more is better. With easy access from models zoos such as HuggingFace and improved accuracy in NLP tasks such as classification and text generation, practitioners are increasingly reaching for these large models. However, deploying them can be a challenge because of their size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Details\n",
    "We'll be working with [Falcon-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct) that was developed by the  Technology Innovation Institute (TII). Falcon-7B-Instruct is a 7B parameters causal decoder-only model built by TII based on Falcon-7B and finetuned on a mixture of Baize. It is made available under the Apache 2.0 license.\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To run this workshop...\n",
    "You need a computer with a web browser, preferably with the latest version of Chrome / FireFox.\n",
    "Sequentially read and follow the instructions described in AWS Hosted Event and Work Environment Set Up\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommended background\n",

    "- Begineers level knowledge and experience with SageMaker Hosting/Inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target audience\n",
    "Data Scientists, ML Engineering, ML Infrastructure, MLOps Engineers, Technical Leaders.\n",
    "Intended for customers working with large Generative AI models including Language, Computer vision and Multi-modal use-cases.\n",
    "Customers using EKS/EC2/ECS/On-prem for hosting or experience with SageMaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Level of expertise - 400\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time to complete\n",
    "Approximately 45 minutes."

    "Prompt engineering is a technique used to design effective prompts for LLMs with the goal to achieve: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Control over the output: With prompt engineering, developers can control the output generated by LLMs. By designing prompts that specify the desired topic, style, tone, and level of formality, they can guide the LLM to produce text that meets the desired criteria.\n",
    "- Mitigating bias: LLMs have been shown to produce biased outputs when prompted with certain topics or language patterns. By engineering prompts that avoid biased language and encourage fairness, developers can help mitigate these issues.\n",
    "- Improving efficiency: Prompt engineering can help LLMs work more efficiently by guiding them to generate the desired output with fewer iterations. By providing clear, concise, and specific prompts, developers can help LLMs achieve the desired outcome faster and with fewer errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a prompt can contain any of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instruction - a specific task or instruction you want the model to perform\n",
    "- Context - can involve external information or additional context that can steer the model to better responses\n",
    "- Input Data - is the input or question that we are interested to find a response for\n",
    "- Output Indicator - indicates the type or format of output.\n",
